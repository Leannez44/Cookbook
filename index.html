    <h2>What's this about?</h2>
    
    <p style="color:cornflowerblue;text-align:center;">Kista's family, like many families, has a collection of recipes that have been used for generations. Many years ago, these recipes were hand written in a  metal spiral notebook for quick and easy reference. Over time, as children moved out and began to prepare meals for their own families, requests were made for these instructions to be distributed for everyone. This collection was then photocopied and bound with the ubiquitous plastic spiral comb notebook of the 1980's office. This site is a chance for Krista's children to access these recipes. A digital format will allow them to make notes, store pictures and share with friends without endangering her precious paper copy.
